# **DAA Final Project**

This project implements three core algorithms from the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course:

## **1. KMP Algorithm**

Efficient pattern-matching algorithm that uses the LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) table to avoid redundant comparisons.
**Time Complexity:** O(n + m)

## **2. AVL Tree**

A self-balancing Binary Search Tree that maintains height balance using rotations.
Supports insertion, deletion, and search in **O(log n)** time.

## **3. Graph Coloring**

A greedy algorithm to assign colors to graph vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.
Used in scheduling, register allocation, and map coloring.


## **Summary**

This project demonstrates efficient string matching, balanced tree operations, and constraint-based graph coloring — three fundamental concepts in algorithm design.
